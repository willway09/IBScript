Notes on usage

ibscript.exe is the command line interpreter. Running it in a terminal followed by a file name will execute the IB Pseudo code in that file.

Example:
ibscript.exe TestCode.ib

IBScript.jar is an executable JAR file which runs the IDE for editing the code. It calls ibscript.exe to execute code. FOR SUCCESSFUL USAGE, BOTH FILES MUST BE IN THE SAME DIRECTORY!

Running IBScript.jar can be achieved by executing the following in a terminal:
java -jar IBScript.jar
